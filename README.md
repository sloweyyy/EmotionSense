# Welcome to EmotionSense ðŸ‘‹

EmotionSense is an application that predicts facial expressions of humans through pictures. This project combines the power of machine learning and user-friendly interface to provide an insightful tool for understanding emotions conveyed through facial expressions.

## Project Overview

EmotionSense leverages a pre-trained machine learning model to analyze facial features in images and classify them into various emotional categories. The application is built using React Native for a cross-platform experience and utilizes a backend server for image processing and communication.

## Get Started

**Frontend:**

1. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Start the app:**

    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

**Backend:**

The backend code is hosted on a separate repository: [Here](https://github.com/sloweyyy/EmotionSenseBackend)

**Machine Learning Model:**

The machine learning model used for facial expression recognition is available at: [Here](https://github.com/sloweyyy/Facial-expression-recognition-through-Portrait-Images)

**Research Paper:**

For a detailed explanation of the methodology and performance of the machine learning model, please refer to the research paper: [Facial Emotion Recognition through Portrait Images](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/380533775_Facial_Expression_Recognition_using_Traditional_Machine_Learning_Models)
